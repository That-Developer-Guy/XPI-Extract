# XPI Extract

This is a simple program with which you can extract .xpi Files, by doppelclicking on them.

# Usage

To use this you just have to open an .xpi File and then you click on "Extract" in the window, in which you can edit the path, which defines where it is saved.

# Installation

## Requirements

1. You will have to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python </a>, make sure to add it to path.
2. Open Command Prompt and enter the following:
   * `pip install pyuac`
   * `pip install pywin32`

## Installation

1. Download the code repository and also move it to a final folder, as you can't move or delete or rename anything in that Folder afterwards.
2. First run the main.py script, it will ask for Administrator permission, because the commands used to associate .xpi Files with the xpi_opener.exe File need those Permissions.
3. Now you can just extract .xpi Files by doppelclicking, you will have a window that pops up.
